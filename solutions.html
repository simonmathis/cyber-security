        <h2>Understanding why it is important to mitigate cybersecurity theats</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity threat mitigation is essential for several reasons. It helps to lessen the impact of security breaches, safeguarding an organization’s assets and reputation. It’s a crucial part of risk management, helping to identify and counteract evolving threats like ransomware and phishing. By prioritizing cybersecurity, organizations can ensure business continuity, limit potential losses, and maintain customer trust. In essence, it’s a proactive measure to protect against potential cyber attacks and preserve the integrity of the organization.</p>
        <h2>Ways to stay safe</h2>
        <ul>
            <button class="collapsible"><strong>Data Encryption and Backups</strong></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Encrypting sensitive information means that only those with the encryption key can access it. Regularly backing up data can prevent loss in the event of a security breach. Encryption restricts data access to those with the encryption key, making it harder for unauthorized parties to read the data. Regular backups ensure a secure copy of your data is available in case of a breach. The 3-2-1 rule is a good backup strategy, suggesting at least 3 copies of your data, stored on 2 different media, with 1 stored offsite.</p>

                <p>Many organizations have cybersecurity tools that are underutilized. Fully leveraging these resources can enhance security and potentially save costs. Many organizations have cybersecurity capabilities that they aren’t fully utilizing. For example, an organization might be licensed for a cybersecurity feature but hasn’t turned it on. Fully utilizing existing tools can enhance security and potentially reduce costs.</p>

                <h2>First Computer Virus</h2>
                <p>The first computer virus ever created was called Creeper and appeared in the early 1970s. It wasn’t malicious—it just displayed a message saying, "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" The first antivirus software, called Reaper, was created to delete Creeper.</p>

                <p>The first known instance of hacking occurred in 1903 when an actor named Samuel Morse (yes, the same guy who invented Morse code) tricked a telegraph operator into sending fake messages, essentially a form of "cyber-attack" back in the day.</p>
